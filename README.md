# Compsys306-Project-1-MLP_SVM
Compsys 306 course project 

## machine learning models for a real-world traffic sign recognition application (MVP, SVM)
- Import the data
- Design the models (multi-layer perceptron and support vector machine models)
- Pre-processing and parameter tuning
- Comparative analysis (e.g. accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) of the model performance
